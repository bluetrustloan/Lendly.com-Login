All big players within the short term loan industry have had negative posts published about them on consumer forums. However, when any payday company is searched in to Google this is always the case. Does this devalue consumer posts on payday loan companies or prove that these firms should not be used when borrowing an instant cash advance?

Short term loan companies are based purely online and offer a simple application process for customers to receive £75 - £750 instantly in their bank accounts. All companies will offer similar interest charges with APR reaching in excess of 3000%. This figure is extraordinary high and needs some research to realise it is not as high as it seems. One lender has differentiated itself from competition by promoting its responsible lending policy; the company offers a transparent service and prides itself on creating an excellent customer relationship and is committed to lending responsibly to customers who can pay back the loan. As part of this, the company urges customers not to take out a cash advance if they know they will not be in a position to pay it back at the end of the month and asks them to read the terms and conditions before the loan is deposited. However, like all short term loan lenders bad press will be posted about this lender from people who default on their loan.
